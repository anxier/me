Hello.

It's that time again.

I don't know if I actually want to kill myself or if it's a delusion but I want to kill myself right now.

If I had the means I would but I've only got 5 milligrams of clonazepam and no alcohol. No razor blades, knives, and no place to properly hang a belt from. Not that I have the energy for any of that.

I'm left with just my obsessions. I've gotten rid of most of my possessions, convinced that they were a geographical binding mechanism. I'm not wrong but I'm not sure how feasible this lifestyle is long term.

The obsessions change with time but always seem to exist. I avoid most people and crave some people. Most people aren't real. Finding the ones that are is like finding a glass of water in a desert. I've been without water so long that I'm not convinced it's real. Not convinced it's not a plant to steal my soul, or worse my intelligence.

I've done nothing but wallow in the sadness of my existence for the past 4 hours. I've cried 5 times in the last 2 days. I can only write this because I'm more confident in my ability to keep this anonymous than I am in people's abilities to not be assholes.

Right now I am sad. Perhaps tomorrow I won't be sad.

It seems unlikely.
