I'm at work.

There's a soft glow of 3 screens in front of me. Larger, large, and small; a 2k display, macbook display, iphone display. Otherwise the room is dark.

I've done it again.

Gone so long without eating that I feel physically weakened. My stomach feels like it's contracted into itself. The notion of consuming food is nauseating.

At the same time I feel like I'm inching closer to death. Suicide by lack of food.

I had a conversation with a friend explaining that I strategically starve myself to extract more time from the day to be more productive. It's true, not worrying about food means I have literally nothing to stop me from working for a block of 8 hours. Except now I feel like I want to die.

She said she guessed we have different priorities. I guess she's not wrong.
